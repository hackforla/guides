### Prerequisite
- You have done the steps in this wiki page for onboarding new team members https://github.com/hackforla/guides/wiki/Joining-the-Team

### Overview
We need an unbiased review of the gather presentation so that we can improve it.

#### Additional Details
You will be working on guide during this issue, but the purpose of this issue is to evaluate and improve the Gather Examples and Interview Teams presentation.  
- Any notes you have about the guide you will be making should be noted in the issue related to the Guide you choose.
- Any notes about the Gather Examples and Interview Teams presentation should be in the document you create.

### Action Items
- [ ] Create a Google doc, with the name ```GT: Notes on Gather presentation - YOUR NAME HERE``` in the Gather Examples folder (customize with your name)
   - [ ] Add the link to the document and its name in the Resources section below
- [ ] Add to the notes document as you go, with observations about the Gather Presentation.  You will encounter some issues, such as font size or other types of formatting changes, what we are looking for though is material changes to the instructions.  For instance, if something could use a screenshot to make it clearer, and it doesn't have one or when you try to follow the steps, something is missing.
   - [ ] If while looking at the presentation (not the guide), you encounter any words that you think should be added to our glossary,  please add them to the Glossary issue as comments.
- [ ] Review the Presentation for Gathering Examples
- [ ] Pick a guide 
   - [ ] Note the Name of guide and URL of the guide in the comments below
- [ ] Use the presentation to work on the guide
   - [ ] Leaving comments in the presentation if you have a suggested improvement
